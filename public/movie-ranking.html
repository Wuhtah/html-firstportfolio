<h3>My Demon</h3>
<p>This is a Korean drama about a human and a 'demon' so to speak, they eventually fall in love with each other and a lot of plot twists and turns happen that leaves you on the egde of your seat. There is also a ton of funny moments, that could be a bit cringy to others, however, it did make me laugh.</p>
<h3>Single's Inferno - Season 3</h3>
<p>I am a huge sucker for reality TV shows, especially when romance is involved. However, the American versions - Too Hot To Handle or Love is Blind always fall a bit short with me. This is another Korean show, but romance reality TV where they are stuck on a 'deserted island' and get to go to 'Paradise' if the contestent chooses you. This season was one of my favorite ones as there was a huge love triangle right up until the end that kept you guessing the entire time!</p>
<h3>This Is Us</h3>
<p>If you are into heart-throbbing and heart-warming all in one episode of less than an hour, this is definitely the show for you. This show is nothing but an emotional roller coaster for me, where I was sad, mad, and happy all in one episode. Prepare the kleenax because you will absolutely need it!</p>
